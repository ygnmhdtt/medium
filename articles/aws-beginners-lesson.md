I've created lessons for AWS beginners.

<!--more-->

I've wrote [AWS_Lv1](https://github.com/ygnmhdtt/AWS_Lv1) for AWS beginners.
This lessons include

* IAM
* VPC
* EC2/EBS
* RDS
* ELB
* Route53
* S3
* CloudFront
* CloudWatch

services.

### What

AWS is a great platform for our system engineering.
But, it's not so easy to use them properly.
To do it, you need to do this:

* Understand IT (For example: OS, network, Linux, Database, DNS, and so on)
* Understand AWS (EC2, VPC, RDS, Route53)

This lessons will fit to people who already know about IT.
If you are beginner for IT, it's too early to do my lessons.

Now, I use my lessons for my team, and it's good way to teach AWS to them.
Please use this for yourself or your team. It's licensed MIT.

Please send me any feedback!
